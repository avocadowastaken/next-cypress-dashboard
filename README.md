# Next Cypress Dashboard üèÑ

## Motivation

This project was inspired by the [Sorry Cypress](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress),
which is absolutely great and production ready alternative to Cypress dashboard
with the single flaw ‚Äì it's complex infrastructure.

So my personal goal was to make more minimalistic approach that focused on:

1. Test parallelisation
2. Easy installation

Differences with the [Sorry Cypress](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress)

- Main functionality of [services](https://sorry-cypress.dev/terminology)
  were replaced by [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- Mongo and In Memory [execution drivers](https://sorry-cypress.dev/director/execution)
  were replaced by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), which only works with
  [SQL databases](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)
- No plans to support [storage driver](https://sorry-cypress.dev/director/storage)
  since videos and snapshots could be stored as CI artifacts.

## Usage

### Deployment

Check [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) and
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/deployment)
deployment guides.

### CI

#### GitHub Actions

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    container: [A, B, C, D, E, F]

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v1

  - run: npm ci

  - uses: umidbekkarimov/next-cypress-dashboard/actions/patch-cypress-config@main
    with:
      api_url: ${{ secrets.NEXT_CYPRESS_DASHBOARD_URL }}

  - run: npx cypress run --record --parallel --ci-build-id=e2e-${{ github.sha }}

  - if: failure()
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    with:
      name: cypress-${{ matrix.container }}
      path: cypress/videos
```

#### Other CI

You can use any CI, but you have to reconfigure Cypress agent to use Next
Cypress Dashboard first. You can check [Sorry Cypress documentation](https://sorry-cypress.dev/quickstart#reconfigure-cypress-agent) for that.
