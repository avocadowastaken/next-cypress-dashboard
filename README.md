## Motivation

This project was inspired by the [Sorry Cypress](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress),
which is absolutely great and production ready alternative to Cypress dashboard
with the single flaw ‚Äì it's complex infrastructure.

So my personal goal was to make more minimalistic approach that focused on:

1. Test parallelization
2. Easy installation

Differences with the [Sorry Cypress](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress)

- Main functionality of [services](https://sorry-cypress.dev/terminology)
  were replaced by [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- Mongo and In Memory [execution drivers](https://sorry-cypress.dev/director/execution)
  were replaced by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), which only works with
  [SQL databases](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)
- No plans to support [storage driver](https://sorry-cypress.dev/director/storage)
  since videos and snapshots could be stored as CI artifacts.
